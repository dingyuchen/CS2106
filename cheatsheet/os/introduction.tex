\section{Introduction to OS}
\emph{Monolithic:} One big special program. Unix variants and Windows NT/XP. (+) Well understood,good performance. (-) highly coupled components.\\
\emph{Microkernel:} Small and clean. Only provides basic and essential facilities (IPC, scheduling, interrupt handler). Higher level services built on top and run as server process outside of the OS (use IPC to communicate). (+) Kernel extensible and better isolation \& protection between kernel and higher level services. (-) lower performance.
